# one-datum

What can we infer about an orbit from the Gaia RV or astrometric jitter?

## Usage

### Environment setup

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge mamba
mamba create -n one-datum -c conda-forge bioconda::snakemake-minimal
conda activate one-datum
```

### Inferring per-transit RV uncertainty

```bash
snakemake infer_noise --cores all --use-conda --conda-frontend mamba
```

To change the parameters, use

This project is meant to be run containerized (although it'll probably also work
fine with a standard scientific Python installation). These instructions will
use [Singularity](https://sylabs.io), but this should also all work using
[Docker](https://www.docker.com).

To start, clone the project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dfm/one-datum.git
cd one-datum
```

### Downloading the data

To download all the necessary data files (using wget), run

```bash
scripts/download /path/to/data
```

where `/path/to/data` is the local path where you want to store the data files.

### Running the container

You can run the container using Singularity as follows (on a module system, you
might need to `module load singularity` first):

```bash
alias singularity_exec="singularity exec --bind /path/to/data:/data docker://ghcr.io/dfm/one-datum:main"
singularity_exec python
```

where `/path/to/data` is the data path that you used above, and on the first
line we're defining an alias that we'll continue using below. This isn't
necessary, but it'll make the demos easier to parse. The above command should
drop you into a Python instance with a correctly configured environment.

### Exploratory analysis with Jupyterlab

This container comes with Jupyterlab installed and you can start a server in
this environment with:

```bash
singularity_exec jupyter lab --ip='*'
```

Since I'm normally running this on a remote machine, I would generally add a
specific port (`--port=8898`, for example) and then forward that port via SSH to
my development machine.

### Inferring per-transit RV uncertainty

This is done on a grid in BP-RP color and apparent G-magnitude. Use

```bash
singularity_exec scripts/infer-per-transit-uncert
```

to run with the default arguments or add the `--help` flag to see the available
parameters. This will save a file `rv_uncertainty_grid.fits` in your data
directory.
